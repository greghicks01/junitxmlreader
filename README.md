# Python Junit XML result reader

This project is a replication of work I did on a commercial project in a Digital Twin. Its not a copy but written completely from scratch not using work computer or facilities.

## Motivation
Reporting the actual unit test results into TestRail from pytest

## Code
The code reads the JUNIT XML using an OOP approach to extract results and aggregate them for reporting into TestRail.

## Purpose
To re-inforce my learning of 
* development in python
* using jira tickets on branches for each stage of development (feature)
* squashing commits and pushing code to the repository

# Outcome
THe code correctly reads the Junit XML and aggregates the results.

Specifically we used this with TestRail repotring in the project, hence this project has a TestRail part.
