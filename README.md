#Python Junit XML result reader

This project is a replication of work I did on a commercail basis to enable unit tests to be reported just like intergration or other tests

## Purpose
To re-inforce my learning of 
* development in python
* using jira tickets on branches for each stage of development (feature)
* squashing commits and pushing code to the repository

# Outcome
THe code correctly reads the Junit XML and aggregates the results.

Specifically we used this with TestRail repotring in the project, hence this project has a TestRail part.
